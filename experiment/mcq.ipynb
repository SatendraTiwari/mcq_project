Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.[7][8]\\n\\nA data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.[9]\\n\\nFoundations\\nData science is an interdisciplinary field[10] focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[11][12] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human–computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[13][14] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.[15]', 'number': 3, 'subject': ('Machine Learning',), 'tone': ('simple',), 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"no\": \"1\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice questions\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"no\": \"2\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice questions\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"no\": \"3\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice questions\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '```json\\n{\"1\": {\"no\": \"1\", \"mcq\": \"Data science is described as an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques and theories from many areas.
